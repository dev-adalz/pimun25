Got it ‚Äî if we‚Äôre setting the bar at **Framer-level, $10k-quality landing page**, then the key is: it‚Äôs not just about flashy animations, it‚Äôs about storytelling + interactivity + polish that screams ‚Äúpremium.‚Äù Let me break down **aesthetic + interaction plan** for your MUN event landing page that uses **Next.js + Framer Motion + GSAP + Lottie animations + Tailwind** stack:

---

## **1. Aesthetic Direction**

* **Overall Feel:** Minimalist luxury ‚Äî dark academia meets global diplomacy. Imagine **black-and-gold** as the base, with **accents of deep navy & emerald** (serious, prestigious, international feel).
* **Typography:**

  * Headlines ‚Üí **Serif, elegant (Playfair Display, Cormorant, or Canela)**.
  * Body ‚Üí **Modern sans-serif (Inter, Neue Haas, or Satoshi)**.
* **Layout Style:**

  * **Full-bleed hero sections** with layered parallax.
  * **Split-screen storytelling** (image on one side, text on the other, with scroll-based transitions).
  * **Glassmorphism elements** for cards (committees, schedule, speakers).
* **Imagery & Motion Graphics:**

  * High-res globe animations (3D WebGL or Lottie).
  * Subtle animated line art (diplomatic motifs: laurel wreaths, maps, flags).
  * Conference photography (previous MUNs, formal suits, committee debates).

## **2. Animation & Interactivity Plan**

* **Hero Section:**

  * Animated **rotating 3D globe** (Three.js or R3F).
  * Framer Motion staggered reveal of title + CTA.
  * Background subtle GSAP gradient waves / particles.
* **On Scroll:**

  * **Parallax scrolling** with Framer Motion spring transitions.
  * **Section-to-section snap transitions** (like Apple product pages).
* **Hover States:**

  * Committee cards expand with Lottie micro-animations (flags waving, books flipping).
  * Sponsor logos transition from grayscale ‚Üí color.
* **Dynamic Schedule:**

  * Interactive timeline with horizontal scroll + smooth easing.
* **Delegates/Speakers Section:**

  * 3D hover tilt effect with depth shadows.
  * Modal popups with smooth fade/scale animations.
* **Call-to-Action (Register Now):**

  * Button with liquid morph animation (Framer Motion path morph).
  * Sticky floating CTA bar that follows scroll subtly.

## **3. Premium Features (That Make It ‚Äú$10k‚Äù Quality)**

* **Personalization:**

  * Dynamic greeting (e.g., ‚ÄúHello, future delegate!‚Äù).
* **Accessibility + Performance:**

  * A11Y compliance, buttery-smooth 60fps animations.
* **SEO + Shareability:**

  * OpenGraph rich previews, social embeds.
* **Extras:**

  * **Countdown timer** to conference with a flipping-card animation.
  * **Custom cursor** (circle with magnetic hover effect).
  * **Ambient background audio toggle** (subtle UN-like gavel sounds / conference murmurs).

## **4. Competitor Benchmarking**

Sites like:

  We‚Äôll merge both ‚Üí prestige + cinematic feel.
